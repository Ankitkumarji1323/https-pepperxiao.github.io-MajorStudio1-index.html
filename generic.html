							<h1>Instruction Set for Strangers</h1>
							<h2>Washington Square Park</h2>
							<h3>Location</h3>
							<p>One of the many unique aspects of New York City is the embedded 
								green spaces that are sectioned off from the rest of the concrete 
								jungle buildings. We knew that we wanted to use a park space for 
								our project because of our common interest in nature, and we 
								ultimately chose Washington Square park due to its close proximity 
								to campus, and it's beautiful arch, fountain, and unique layout.
							</p>
							<h3>Design Research</h3>
							<p>We walked around the park and carefully recorded what we saw and 
								where we saw it. We noticed that other than the intensional division
								 of the park by its properties and roads, there is also a clear 
								 division between the people that gather around the park, noticeably 
								 the homeless people. We want to connect people of different groups 
								 and ages that are within the park proximity, and to create something 
								 that can be enjoyed by everyone.<br>
                            </p>

							<p></p>
							<p>
								During our time at the park we also interviewed a young vendor. 
								We found her on the benches at the east side of the fountain, 
								and she informed us that she comes to the park on most days and 
								nights to sell ice cold water, soda, and other refreshments. She
								also says that she knows many of the other vendors and folks who
								frequent the park, such as police officers (who were mostly 
								there for show), parks workers, addicts, and homeless people.

							<h2>AEIOU Design Method</h2>
							<img style="max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;"src="images/AEIOU.jpg"
							<p></p>
							<h2>Behavioral Mapping</h2>
							<img style="max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;"src="images/behaviousmap2.gif"
							<p>Through the process of Behavioral Mapping, we found that there was always
								 a bunch of homeless people gathering in a corner of the park. This place
								  became a little Kingdom for these people who seldom interact with others.
								 Therefore, we started to think about ways which could bring some joy to
								 them.
							</p>
							<h2>Brainstorming Tree</h2>
							<img style="max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;"src="images/brainstormingTree.png"
							<p></p>
							<h2>Our Concept</h2>
							<p>
								Our concept is to connect the people of different communities that reside
								 within the park through fun and whimsical interactions. To do so, we chose 
								 a medium that can travel distance, and able to be enjoyed by people of all 
								 ages, BUBBLES! Ultimately we want bubble machines to be disguised in different 
								 structures within the park. It would be a very cute and decorative approach 
								 where bubble machines could be covered up amongst some playful objects that 
								 we make ourselves, like iridescent, geometric sculptures made of translucent 
								 films, or, it would be from a curious approach as well. Since people tend to 
								 approach things that intrigue them curiously, it would be a fun idea to put 
								 bubble machines in unlikely places, such as inside trash cans, hidden among 
								 bushes and trees, or inside stuffed animals that we leave around the park.
                                 <br><br>
								Before we spend too much resources getting actual bubble machines, we want
								 to test the range of reach for the bubbles in different locations, and see 
								 how people would react them. We plan to hang up webs with loops on them, 
								 and dip them in soapy water to see if the area is windy enough to produce 
								 bubbles on its own and let it travel across the park.

							<h2>Prototype</h2>
							<img style="max-width:100%;overflow:hidden;"src="images/Prototype1.jpg"
							<p></p>
							<h2>Interface for interaction</h2>
							<p>
								A shared canvas or making surface, where strangers and passerbys can 
								contribute to a shared piece of art, while still maintaining a safe 
								and comfortable distance. This point of interaction should provide 
								opportunities for person-to-person, person-to-group, and person-to-public. 
								We hope that this installation will culminate in a lasting artifact, 
								created by the collective curiosity and joy of park-goers.

							<h2>Materials</h2>
							<h3>1.Interface</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Canvas / surface to make on</li>
								<li>Various types of bubble makers</li>
								<li>Easel</li>
								<li>Different colored bubble solutions</li>
								<li>Eventually, podiums to mount each bubble maker in front of the making surface</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>2.Wayfinding / indicators</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Colored indicators around the podiums ("personal bubbles," if you will)</li>
								<li>Perhaps, if more clarity is necessary, further indicators on the park grounds</li>
							</ul>
